				<p>Working memory deficits are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders including
					Alzheimer’s, Parkinsons, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and dementia. As
					diagnostic technologies advance, there is a need for early onset therapy and
					prevention. The current standard of care is a pharmaceutical approach. With that approach,
					adverse effects and complications can arise from unintended interactions with ongoing bodily
					processes, and these pharmaceuticals are rarely personalized to the patient. </p>
				<p>In recent years, the
					emergence of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has gained momentum as it directly targets
					the area of interest through cortical modulation. Specifically, transcranial alternating current
					stimulation (tACS) is the process of applying alternating electrical current at a set frequency
					to
					interact with the brain’s natural cortical oscillations. tACS relies on the electrical nature of
					biological circuits in the body. Underlying cortical oscillations of neurons can be manipulated
					in
					a process known as entrainment. This process is similar to the mechanism involved in
					binaural beats in which the cortical oscillation are altered via the input of two different sine
					waves in the form of sound. In addition, the electrical impedance of the neurons can be altered
					through the application of current to the scalp. Unlike transcranial direct current
					stimulation (tDCS), tACS applies sinusoidal alternating current to the brain, closely mimicking
					the natural oscillations, whereas tDCS applies a constant current. Research has suggested that
					tACS can help improve symptoms of Alzheimers, Parkinsons, ADHD, and dementia through
					entrainment of various neuronal groups and improving the working memory of these individuals. Not
					only can tACS therapy help those with neurological disorders, but also individuals
					who are simply looking to increase their working memory. This is done by intensifying the
					gamma waves in active regions of the brain and suppressing alpha waves in inactive regions.</p>
				<p>However, most tACS devices used today are feedforward systems, meaning that a
					preprogrammed waveform is generated by the device and sent to the brain. Once the signal has
					been applied, there is no way to adjust it to better adapt to the patient to maximize results.
					This
					project aims to create a closed loop device that will utilize EEG feedback to fine tune the tACS
					application to better suit each person’s brain and correct for individual brain response.</p>
